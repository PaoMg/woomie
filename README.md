# Woomie | Final project Data analytics bootcamp - Mexico City

## Introduction

This repository presents the final project of Ironhack Mexico's Data analytics bootcamp.

**Woomie's** goal is to provide Mexican women alternative mobility routes, avoiding insecure areas on public roads in Mexico City.

The general functionality is as follows: the user indicates the point of origin, the point of destination and the method of transportation by which the user is going to move, either walking, by car or by bicycle. 

The final result provides 3 maps: 
- The first one traces 2 routes, a lower-risk route and a higher-risk route. Both with the kilometers and the time it will take to go through them.
- The second one indicates on a 5-color scale the severity of crimes committed on public roads.
- The third one shows on a 3-color scale the time of the day when the crimes were committed on public streets (morning: 05:00 to 12:00, afternoon: 13:00 - 20:00, night: 21:00 - 04:00)

## Getting Started

Open the `main.ipynb` file in the `your-code` directory. Follow the instructions and add your code and explanations as necessary. By the end of this lab, you will have learned how to use the SciPy package.

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
